## What is PodTeksT?

PodTeksT is a web app that analyzes chat exports from popular messaging platforms. It computes **150+ quantitative metrics** entirely client-side (your raw messages never leave your device) and runs a **multi-pass AI psychological analysis** server-side using the Gemini API.

Every metric is backed by academic research — fake citations have been replaced, formulas validated against published methodology, and clinical-sounding labels renamed to neutral language following a comprehensive scientific audit.

### Privacy First
- **Raw messages processed client-side** — never sent to any server
- Only 200-500 sampled messages sent to Gemini per AI pass
- All data stored locally (IndexedDB / localStorage)
- GDPR-friendly — delete your data anytime
- Rate limiting + CSP headers on all endpoints

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Format | Import Method |
|---|---|---|
| Facebook Messenger | JSON export | File upload |
| WhatsApp | TXT export | File upload |
| Instagram DM | JSON export | File upload |
| Telegram | JSON export | File upload |
| Discord | API | Bot integration |

Auto-detection identifies the platform from file structure.
